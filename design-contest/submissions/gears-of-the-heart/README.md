# Gears of the Heart

This is the first submission to the Design Contest, and it is designed by Nivedita Chandra ([nivedita](https://community.humanetech.com/u/nivedita/summary)).

The beautiful design symbolizes how technology affects our human lives. Technology is everywhere and its impact on our livestyle, behaviours and society as a whole becomes ever larger. Much of this new tech is introduced to us as-is for a singular purpose, without proper attention and consideration of its creators on how it will affect the people that use it.

But by looking at the broader picture - taking the extra effort to look holistically at the implications a new technology, product or service introduction will have - we can create things of true beauty, things of real value. Things that truly touch the heart and make us tick.

Design files are also included as Encapsulated Postscript (EPS).
